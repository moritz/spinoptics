1. Motivation
    What for?
        quantum computations
        low-power transistor
    Why spins?
        low decay rates
        little power consumption
        intrinsic QM property
    Prior art
        ferromagnetic materials
        + very good spin separation
# TODO: picture of hard disk; Giant magneto resistance
        - hard to handle technologically
        - metals => unwanted Schottky junctions
        - not tunable
        => unusable in CPUs 

2. Basics
    Rashba Spin-Orbit Interaction
        From Dirac equation
        in solids: gap smaller => larger effect
        k-dependent SO-coupling
    Fisher-Lee relation
        Green's Functions
# TODO: picture excitation + response
        Fisher-Lee relation
        discretization

3. Setup: Interface at an angle
    Analytical calculations
        Khodas' approach
        critical effects
        but only in chiral basis
        adapting to z-direction
    Numeric calculations
        enumerating sites
        matrix sizes
        interfaces

4. Results
    Rough agreement simulation <=>  analytical calculation
        difference: number of modes, effective model
    Some spin separation survives (20% max)

5. Summary
    Spins are very interesting for quantum comptuation
    Non-magnetic materials necessary for future scaling
    Rashba SO-coupling: critical filtration in chiral basis
    Up to 20% survive in non-chiral basis
