\chapter{Summary and Outlook}
\label{sec:summary}

We analyzed the possibilities of achieving spin polarization in a
non-magnetic, microscopic semiconductor. We found that an interface between
normal and Rashba spin-orbit coupling areas splits an electron beam into
components with different chirality, and if the angle between the interface
and the incident beam exceeds a critical angle, the beam with $+$ chirality
ceases to propagate. This effect can be used to achieve spin polarization.

We modeled such a system analytically in order to obtain a good understanding
for the physics, and in an extensible numerical simulation in order to have
maximal flexibility with the choice of parameters and system details.

We developed a method to compare the analytical and numerical results, and in
that course we found that the measurable spin polarization is partially
absorbed by fact that the
interface separates electron waves by chirality, not by spin component
in $z$-direction.

We also discussed the experimental more accessible setup of two regions with
different, non-zero strength of spin-orbit interaction, and found that such an
interface can also be used to achieve some spin polarization, albeit
of decreasing magnitude when the spin-orbit coupling strengths become similar. 

In both cases a large angle between the incident beam the interface is
essential for obtaining a decent spin polarization.


Future work in this area could involve a four-band model which includes both
the conductance and valance band for each spin direction, would
allow more precises modeling of a particular semiconductor, and thus be of
more help to experimentalists. Using more realistic and specific parameters
would allow to make quantitative recommendations on which angle best to use
for such an interface.

There is also another simple extension to our model that would help making
quantitative predictions: when the spin-orbit coupling in an area is tuned by
applying a gate voltage, not only the spin-orbit coupling strength changes,
but also a potential barrier is built up, which scatters electron in a
spin-independent way. Taking these barriers into account will probably not
enhance our understanding of the spin polarization, but is crucial for
obtaining quantitative predictions of the measured signals.
